Source code for Chapter 2, Code-level Integration,
 of Making Java Groovy by Ken Kousen, http://manning.com/kousen.

The source includes a Gradle build file that will compile
all the code and run all the tests, ultimately producing HTML
output in build/reports/test/index.html.

If you have gradle installed, run
> gradle build

otherwise, the wrapper will download and install gradle for you:

> gradlew build

NOTE: THE GRADLE BUILD WILL FAIL THE FIRST TIME! This is because
I'm using @Immutable on a Groovy class and instantiating it using
an explicit constructor, which the compiler doesn't realize is
available until the class is compiled.  JUST RUN THE BUILD AGAIN
and everything is fine. :)
