Source code for Chapter 1 of Making Java Groovy by Ken Kousen.

The source includes a Gradle build file that will compile
all the code and run all the tests, ultimately producing HTML
output in build/reports/test/index.html.

If you have gradle installed, run
> gradle build

otherwise, the wrapper will download and install gradle for you:

> gradlew build

Notes:
    1. I included the WSDL and schema files in the repo,
    even though they're generated by the build, just in case
    you don't want to generate them or you want to see them
    ahead of time.
    
    2. In order for the tests to work in the Ch07_CalculatorClient
    project to work, you have to run the mjg.calc.service.CalculatorServer
    application using the normal java command. The client project
    generates its stubs from the deployed application, which is
    running on http://localhost:1234/calc
